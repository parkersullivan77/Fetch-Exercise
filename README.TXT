This program is pretty simple just a get request.

1.Use "dotnet run" in the terminal to launch the program

2.Once running use the link https://localhost:5001/api/Pyramids/"whatever word you want"(might have to continue to "unsafe" site based on your securty preferences)

3.See the results either TRUE indicating it is a pyramid word or FALSE indicating it is not a pyramid word

(OPTIONAL)4.Once running, open postman which is used for api testing and copy step two link into GET request bar(optional for best viewing results)
